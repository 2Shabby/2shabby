### 2Shabby

I work on software that runs locally, behaves sensibly, and can be stopped and understood when something goes wrong. Most of what I build is tooling rather than end-user products.

#### What I’m Working On

**[Jeeves Runtime](https://github.com/Jeeves-Cluster-Organization/jeeves-core)**  
A runtime for long-running agent tasks that can be paused and resumed instead of restarted from scratch.

**[Code Analysis](https://github.com/Jeeves-Cluster-Organization/jeeves-capability-code-analysis)**  
Tools for exploring large codebases while being strict about what can and can’t be claimed.

**[Voice on the Edge](https://github.com/Jeeves-Cluster-Organization/voice_radxa_gateway)**  
Local voice input and speech synthesis on a Radxa Rock 5, without relying on cloud services.

#### Past Work

**[Quantum State Generation](https://github.com/2Shabby/broadcastability_ml_project)**  
Experiments around generating valid quantum states using machine learning.

**[Witness Learning](https://github.com/Jeeves-Cluster-Organization/ML_QML_Witness_Generation)**  
Looking at whether machine learning can help reduce measurement overhead in entanglement studies.
